Abstrac:

This paper presents a novel approach, the Reinforcement Learning Based Fault-Tolerant Control (RL-FTC) strategy, designed to address sensor faults in control systems. Initially, a closed-loop system is established using the Conventional Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. To investigate the system's robustness, a simulated sensor fault is intentionally introduced, and the corresponding results are analyzed. In addition to the RL-FTC strategy, we propose the utilization of the Double Q-Learning (DQL) algorithm to tackle unknown faults in the control system. This enhanced approach aims to improve the performance of the controller under challenging conditions, ensuring reliable operation even in the presence of unexpected faults. To evaluate the effectiveness of both strategies, a comprehensive study is conducted on a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) system, a representative benchmark for control applications. Through extensive experimentation, the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RL-FTC strategy compared to the Conventional Q-Learning (CQL) algorithm, particularly in critical and sensitive systems like the CSTR. The key contribution of this research lies in the ability of the RL-FTC approach to enhance the speed of decision-making, an essential aspect in managing time-sensitive systems. By effectively addressing sensor faults and improving control performance, this method proves to be a promising solution for real-world applications in fault-tolerant control systems. By combining theoretical analysis, simulation studies, and practical experiments on the CSTR system, this paper offers valuable insights into the development of robust and reliable control strategies, opening avenues for further research in the field of reinforcement learning-based fault-tolerant control.
